<h1> <b> the voice i created in my head </b> </h1>


<p> <em> <b> there's peace in silence </b> </em> </p>
i keep looking for 
<em> solitude <em> <br>
 in noisy places. </p>
  
 <p> <em> - please be quiet </em> </p>
  <br>
 <br>

 <p> <em> <b> flower girl </b> </em> </p> 
 i want to be the kind of pretty <br>
 that is rewarded with flowers. <br>
 a <em> beautiful, </em> vibrant gesture <br>
 of someone's love. <br>
 <br>
 <em> <b> - will i ever be pretty enough? </em> </b>
